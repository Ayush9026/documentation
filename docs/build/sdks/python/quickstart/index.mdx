# Python QuickStart

Follow these steps to use the Pieces Python SDK.

## Download Pieces OS

:::info

You must either have Pieces OS installed on your local machine or have access to a remote instance of Pieces OS to use this SDK.

:::

Download [**Pieces OS**](/installation-getting-started/pieces-os) for your operating system:

- [**macOS**](/installation-getting-started/macos)
- [**Windows**](/installation-getting-started/windows)
- [**Linux**](/installation-getting-started/linux)

## Install Python SDK

Use pip to install the Pieces Python SDK using the following command:

```sh
pip install pieces_os_client
```

## Initialize SDK

After installing the SDK, you must initialize the SDK with your base URL. The base URL will depend on your setup.

If you are using a local instance of Pieces OS:
- On macOS/Windows, use http://localhost:1000
- On Linux, use http://localhost:5323

If you are using a remote instance of Pieces OS, use the URL you have set up for that.

## Getting started

Create a Python script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server. Create a `main.py` file to test the connection.

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient
import platform

# Defining the port based on the operating system
platform_info = platform.platform()
if 'Linux' in platform_info:
   port = 5323
else:
   port = 1000

pieces_client = PiecesClient(config={'host': f'http://localhost:{port}'})
```

In the code snippet above, we use the platform package to determine the base URL based on the operating system.

Run the following command to execute the script:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
