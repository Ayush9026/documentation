Follow these steps to use the Pieces Python SDK.

## Download Pieces OS

:::info

You must either have Pieces OS installed on your local machine or have access to a remote instance of Pieces OS to use this SDK.

:::

Download [**Pieces OS**](/installation-getting-started/pieces-os) for your operating system:

- [**macOS**](/installation-getting-started/macos)
- [**Windows**](/installation-getting-started/windows)
- [**Linux**](/installation-getting-started/linux)

## Install Python SDK

Use pip to install the Pieces Python SDK using the following command:

```sh
pip install pieces_os_client
```

## Initialize SDK

After installing the SDK, you must initialize the SDK with your base URL. The base URL will depend on your setup.

If you are using a local instance of Pieces OS:
- On macOS/Windows, use http://localhost:1000
- On Linux, use http://localhost:5323

If you are using a remote instance of Pieces OS, use the URL you have set up for that.

```python
from pieces_copilot_sdk import PiecesClient

# Replace 'your_base_url' with your actual base URL
pieces_client = PiecesClient(config={'baseUrl': 'your_base_url'})
```

## Getting started

First, we will create a Python script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server. This involves creating a config.py file to store your configuration info and a wellknown.py file to test the connection.

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient
import platform

# Defining the port based on the operating system
platform_info = platform.platform()
if 'Linux' in platform_info:
   port = 5323
else:
   port = 1000

pieces_client = PiecesClient(config={'baseUrl': f'http://localhost:{port}'})
```

## Determining Your Base URL

In the code snippet above, we use the platform package to determine the base URL based on the operating system.

Run the following command to execute the script:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
