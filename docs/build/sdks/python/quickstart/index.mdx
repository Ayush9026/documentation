Follow these steps to use the Pieces Python SDK.

## Download Pieces OS

:::info

You must either have Pieces OS installed on your local machine or have access to a remote instance of Pieces OS to use this SDK.

:::

Download [**Pieces OS**](/installation-getting-started/pieces-os) for your operating system:

- [**macOS**](/installation-getting-started/macos)
- [**Windows**](/installation-getting-started/windows)
- [**Linux**](/installation-getting-started/linux)

## Install Python SDK

Use pip to install the Pieces Python SDK using the following command:

```sh
pip install pieces_os_client
```

## Initialize SDK

After installing the SDK, you must initialize the SDK with your base URL. The base URL will depend on your setup.

If you are using a local instance of Pieces OS:
- On macOS/Windows, use http://localhost:1000
- On Linux, use http://localhost:5323

If you are using a remote instance of Pieces OS, use the URL you have set up for that.

```python
from pieces_copilot_sdk import PiecesClient

# Replace 'your_base_url' with your actual base URL
pieces_client = PiecesClient(config={'baseUrl': 'your_base_url'})
```

## Getting started

First, we will create a Python script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server. This involves creating a config.py file to store your configuration info and a wellknown.py file to test the connection.

```python
import pieces_os_client
import platform

# Defining the port based on the operating system. For Linux, the port is 5323, and for macOS/Windows, the port is 1000.
platform_info = platform.platform()
if 'Linux' in platform_info:
    port = 5323
else:
    port = 1000

# The `basePath` defaults to http://localhost:1000, however we need to change it to the correct port based on the operating system.
configuration = pieces_os_client.Configuration(host=f"http://localhost:{port}")

# Initialize the Pieces ApiClient
api_client = pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration)

# Enter a context with an instance of the ApiClient
with pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the WellKnownApi class
    api_instance = pieces_os_client.WellKnownApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Retrieve the (wellknown) health of the Pieces OS
        api_response = api_instance.get_well_known_health()
        print("The response of WellKnownApi().get_well_known_health:")
        print(api_response) # Response: ok
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling WellKnownApi->get_well_known_health: %s\n" % e)
```

Run the following command to execute the script:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
